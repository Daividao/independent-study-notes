# Self-study Course Solutions

## Overview
This repository contains my solutions to assignments from various online courses I've completed during my self-study journey. It serves as a personal archive and reference for my learning progress.

Why self-study, you ask? Well, let's just say that getting a master's degree costs an arm, a leg, and possibly a kidney these days. So instead of selling my organs on the black market, I decided to embark on this DIY education adventure. Who needs a fancy degree when you've got determination, internet access, and an unhealthy amount of caffeine, right?

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized by course, with each course having its own directory. Within each course directory, you'll find subdirectories or files for individual assignments or projects.

## Courses Included
**[Neural Network: Zero to Hero]** - This [course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) is taught by the legendary Andrej Karpathy on Youtube. 

**[Optimization Models in Engineering]** - This [course](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/EECS127/) is EECS 127 from UC Berkeley. I didn't take it when I was a student there, but it turned out to be very important if I need to understand math heavy ML papers or get into robotics. In addition, it taught optimization which is pervasive in ML / AI world. I think Berkeley has decided to make the class private, so I don't think it's accessible by the public anymore.

## Disclaimer
These solutions are my own work and are meant for reference and learning purposes only. If you're currently enrolled in any of these courses, I encourage you to develop your own solutions to maximize your learning experience.
